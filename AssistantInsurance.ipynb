    "When extracting make sure you follow the context and instructions given below::\\\\n\\\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ncontext = \\\"\\\"\\\"## Health Insurance Plan Data Extraction Guidelines\\r\\n### Context\\r\\n \\r\\nYou are tasked with extracting health insurance plan data from provided information, ensuring high accuracy and consistency in data representation. The data extraction requires attention to detail in mapping specific keys to their corresponding values based on the structure and examples provided below.\\r\\n \\r\\n### Instructions\\r\\n1. **Key-Value Mapping:**\\r\\n   - Extract key-value pairs by mapping keys separated by slashes with their corresponding values also separated by slashes.\\r\\n     - **Example:** \\\"Out-of-pocket maximum (individual/family) $16,500/$33,000\\\" should be extracted as:\\r\\n       - Out-of-pocket maximum individual: $16,500\\r\\n       - Out-of-pocket maximum family: $33,000\\r\\n \\r\\n2. **Plan Data Extraction:**\\r\\n   - Ensure all plans are extracted without omission.\\r\\n   - For `RX Tiers` and pharmacy-related data, values should be mapped across retails includes(Generic, Preferred Brand, Non-Preferred Brand, Specialty). Separate each item with a slash, Include only the values without explanations and without any prefix or suffix.\\r\\n     - **Example:** If you encounter multiple retail items like Retail Generic Copay = $w, Retail Pref Brand Copay = $x, Retail Non-Pref Brand Copay = $y, Retail Specialty Brand Copay extract as $w/$x/$y/$z.\\r\\n   - The \\\"Plan Type\\\" field should be one of 'PPO' or 'HSA' or 'HSA Compatible' or 'HSA Non-Compatible' based on quote provided.\\r\\n \\r\\n3. **Plan Name Extraction:**\\r\\n   - While picking plan name make sure to pick only what ever is mapped against 'plan' or 'plan name' \\r\\n     first see is there anything listed against 'plan name' extract that and assign\\r\\n     - **Example:**             HSA Open Access Plus\\r\\n                                HSA\\r\\n                Plan Offering   Quadruple Option\\r\\n                Plan Name       HSA (17276554)\\r\\n                Medical Management Model Included\\r\\n        in the above text even though first 3 rows seems like plan name since 'HSA (17276554)' is mapped against 'Plan Name' should pick 'HSA (17276554)' as value\\r\\n   - Extract the complete plan name or product type, avoiding abbreviations.\\r\\n     - **Example:** Use \\\"KPLF 1500/15%/4000\\\" instead of a shortened form like \\\"KPLF 1500\\\".\\r\\n   - Extract the plan name along with plan id/number\\r\\n     - **Example:** Use \\\"HSA (17276554)\\\" instead of HSA\\r\\n   - If the extraction is from SBC do include only the text after the keyword 'draft' in plan name\\r\\n     - **Example:** given \\\"Health Savings Account Open Access Plus - DRAFT HSA UW\\\" extract as \\\"HSA UW\\\"\\r\\n \\r\\n4. **Special Instructions:**\\r\\n   - Convert \\\"Level Funding\\\" to \\\"Level Funded\\\".\\r\\n   - Simplify carrier names, e.g., 'Cigna Healthcare' to 'Cigna'.\\r\\n   - For the Colorado market, the 'Outpatient Surgery' field should be left empty.\\r\\n   - Use the descriptions provided to determine the \\\"funding arrangement\\\" percentage.\\r\\n   - When extracting data for \\\"Enrolment\\\" make sure its extracted from \\\"Actual\\\" Column and should not take from \\\"Eligible\\\". Take a step by step approach like below\\r\\n     [step 1]: make sure the data extracted is revalant to enrollment\\r\\n     [step 2]: collect all the columns that has enrollment data (example: 'eligible' and 'actual')\\r\\n     [step 3]: now make sure you take data thats under 'actual' column and extract the data map it to the json schema\\r\\n     [step 4]: always note that data under 'eligible' column is irrelavant and not needed\\r\\n   - For 'Lab' field take the value from 'Lab Services - Ind. Lab'\\r\\n   - For 'X-ray' field take the value from 'Lab Services - Ind. Lab'\\r\\n   - For 'Advanced Imaging' field take the value from 'Adv. Radiology - Outpatient'\\r\\n   - When extracted value has '^' symbol make sure that is also part of the text extracted note it important not to truncate or trim it\\r\\n   - For 'Rx-Deductible' field if the current plan name has 'HSA' or 'HSA Compatible' assign the string 'Plan Deductible' else if the current plan name is 'PPO' or 'OAP' mark it as NA\\r\\n   - Do not include \\\"Plan Pays\\\" or 'plan pays' text. remove it if its present in any extracted value\\r\\n   - If you any of the field name has 'copay' text append 'copay' to the value extracted\\r\\n\\r\\n6. **Network Type Mapping:**\\r\\n   - The \\\"Network Type\\\" field should be either \\\"OAP\\\" or \\\"HSA OAP\\\" depending on the quote\\r\\n   - If 'HSA Open Access Plus' appears in the product name, consider it as 'HSA OAP'.\\r\\n   - If only 'Open Access Plus' or 'OAP' appears, map it as 'OAP'.\\r\\n \\r\\n7. **Plan Type Mapping:**\\r\\n   - The \\\"Plan Type\\\" field should be either 'HSA' or 'OAP' or 'PPO'\\r\\n   - If there is HSA in Plan Name  mark it as 'HSA' else its 'OAP' or 'PPO' depending on the plan name\\r\\n \\r\\n8. **Enrollment Mapping:**\\r\\n   - When extrating data for enrollment make sure what is extracted is a number\\r\\n   - When multiple columns has value for enrollment example: actual and eligible. pick values in actuals\\r\\n   - Always remember we need to map actuals to enrollment\\r\\n   - **Example:** Lets say we have the below text the values should be extracted from Actual column so the extracted values will be (11,0,1,2)                            \\r\\n                                      Eligible Actual\\r\\n                     Employee         71       11    \\r\\n                     Emp + Spouse     5        0     \\r\\n                     Emp + Child(ren) 4        1     \\r\\n                     Emp + Family     4        2\\r\\n\\r\\n9. **JSON Formatting:**\\r\\n   - Provide the extracted data in JSON format, grouped by plan.\\r\\n   - Ensure adherence to the conventions for accurate data representation.\\r\\n \\r\\n\\\"\n",
